# UCSB_sklearn_workshop
A repository of code and data for the USCB sklearn workshop on February 7th &amp; 8th, 2019


# General outline

## Day 1

**Kaai can arrive early (8:00 AM) to informally talk about using pandas and numpy for reading and processing data if there is interest**

### Morning 10:00 AM - ~12:00 PM

* Lecture - Basics of machine learning (1-2 hrs)
    * Training and test set
    * Model types, & model complexity
    * Basic data types
    * Data imbalance 
    * Performance metrics
    * Advanced data types (NLP, computer-vision, time-series, etc.)

* Code along - First pass: band gap regression (1 hr)
    * download data
    * perform a train-test split
    * convert formulae to features
    * perform linear regression (linear learner)
    * perform random-forest regression (non-linear)
    * generate error metrics & figures

### Afternoon 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM

* Code along - Second pass: band gap regression (1.5 hrs)
    * remove duplicates and make sure data looks okay
    * perform a train-test split
    * convert formula to features
    * discuss model parameter selection
    * implement cross-validation
    * implement grid-search
    * generate error metrics & figures

* Individual work - Aflow regression: predicting bluk modulus (until the end of day)
    * Implement code (Taylor/Kaai will be avaliable for questions)
        - Fill out individual code sections. Answers are revealed before moving on (4 or 5 parts).

### Homework: Think about data that might be interesting to learn on. We will talk about your ideas in the morning. 


## Day 2

* Code along (do you want this many coding examples?) - A quick classification problem: predicting crystal structure (1 hr)
    * Augment same code structure for classification
    * generate error metrics & review recal vs precision.

* Individual work - metal/non-metal band gap classification.
    * Work through full ML work flow while 
    * Coaching - Discuss research ideas and data with Taylor/Kaai


## Bonus material (things we can talk about if there is extra time):

    * using matplotlib to make publication quality figures
